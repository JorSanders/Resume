          <hr class="resume-heading-hr" />
          <p>I am a 25 year old software developer. Mainly specialized in back-end web development, besides back-end
            work I enjoy working on a wide range of subjects. One of the skills I take pride in is to be able to
            explain technical concepts in layman's terms. Because of this I have often been asked by colleagues to
            collaborate with them on a wide variety of items. E.g. Frontend, CI/CD automation, Database Administration,
            Linux Server Management and incident response. In this way I see myself as a real
            <b class="primary-color">teamplayer</b> who is always ready to help others out
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Capgemini</b> (11/2019 - 5/2022). During this time I worked as a backend developer on
              <b class="primary-color">DigiD</b> for <b>Logius</b>. Here I helped to containerize, split the monolith
              application into micro-services and connected to eIDAS (European electronic identification). Yet the thing
              I am most proud of is unofficially becoming the first point of contact from the Ops teams when they needed
              help or cooperation from the development teams.
            </li>
            <li><b>Perfect Web Team</b> (2/2017 - 8/2019). During my studies I worked as a part time web and backend
              developer. The work mostly consisted of making custom Joomla! components using OOP PHP, Git and MySQL. As
              my graduation-internship I set up a CI/CD environment for PWT.
            </li>
            <li><b>The Valley</b> (9/2018 - 1/2019). During this internship I worked in a Scrum team, together we
              re-designed and rebuilt the website <a href="https://www.fcutrecht.nl/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">fcutrecht.nl</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnovate</b> (9/2017 - 1/2018). In a team of interns we build a C# Library for <a
                href="https://www.pozyx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pozyx</a>. Pozyx is hardware
              used for indoor location tracking. Cinnovate used this indoor location tracking for some of their
              projects, mainly a self driving wheelchair.

          <p><b>HBO-ICT at Windesheim Flevoland</b> (8/2015 - 6/2019) is where I
            graduated. During the first year of the study we learned a basis of IT skills. From the 2nd year onwards
            we got to apply that knowledge at internships. I have done <b class="primary-color">5 internships</b>
            of each half a year. Which gave me a lot of experience working with different technologies, companies and
            people. During this study I have also done a Minor, I chose to do this abroad, studying for half a year at
            Wenzhou University in China.

          <p>After a day of work I enjoy playing team games like Overwatch, Apex Legends or League of Legends. During
            weekends I enjoy having board game nights or going to bars.</p>
          <p>I would love to learn more about Kubernetes, Front-end development and pentesting. During my free time I
            often browse Reddit, Youtube or listen to Podcast to learn more about these and other technical subjects
