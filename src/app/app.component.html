          <hr>
          <p>I am a 25 year old software developer. Mainly specialized in back-end webdevelopment besides back-end work
            I enjoy working on a wide range of subjects. One of the skills I take pride in is to be able to explain
            technical concepts in layman's terms.
            because of this I have often been asked by colleagues to collaborate with them on wide variety of items.
            E.g. Frontend, CI/CD automation, Database Administration, Linux Server Management and incident response.
            In this way I see myself as a real teamplayer who is always ready to <b class="primary-color">help
              others</b> out.

          <h2 class="resume-heading">Experience</h2>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Capgemini</b> (11/2019 - 5/2022). During this time I have worked as a backend developer on
              <b class="primary-color">DigiD</b> for <b>Logius</b>. This was my first experience at a Large Company. I
              noticed that fairly
              quickly I got the hang of it. And from asking questions transitioned to answering questions. Got to work
              more and more interesting items. And gaining more responsibilities. The thing I am most proud of is
              unofficially becoming the first point of contact from the Ops teams when they needed help from developer.
            </li>
            <li><b>Perfect Web Team</b> (2/2017 8/2019). In 2017 I started with an internship at Perfect Web Team. After
              this I started working part time during my studies as a backend developer, mostly during school holidays.
              In 2019 I did a second internship here and after graduating I worked for another two months before going
              traveling and switching to Capgemini.
            </li>
            <li><b>The Valley</b> (9/2018 1/2019). During this internship I worked in a Scrum team, together we build
              the new <a href="https://www.fcutrecht.nl/">website</a> for <b>FC Utrecht</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnovate</b> (9/2017 1/2018). In a team of interns we build a C# Library for <a
                href="https://www.pozyx.io/">Pozyx</a>. Pozyx is hardware used for indoor location tracking.
              Cinnovate needed this indoor location tracking for some of their projects, mainly a self driving
              wheelchair.
            </li>

          <h2 class="resume-heading">Education</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>I graduated from <b><span class="primary-color">HBO-ICT</span> at Windesheim Flevoland</b>. During the
            first year of the study we learned
            a basis of IT skills. From the 2nd year onwards we had to apply our knowledge in internships.
            In have I done 5 internships of each half a year. Which gave me a lot of experience working with different
            technologies, companies and people.
            Besides the internships of course I have also done a Minor, I chose to do this abroad, studing for half a
            year at Wenzhou University in China.
