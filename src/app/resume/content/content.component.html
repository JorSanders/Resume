            <hr class="resume-heading-hr" />
            <p>I am a 25 year old software developer.
                Besides my main specialization in back-end web development I enjoy working on a wide range of subjects.
                I take pride in being able to explain complex technical concepts in layman's terms.
                Because of this I have often been asked by colleagues to collaborate with them on a variety of items
                (e.g. front-end, CI/CD automation, database administration, Linux server management and
                incident response).
                In this way I see myself as a real <b class="primary-color">team player</b>,
                who is always ready to help others out.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Back-end developer | Capgemini</b> (11/2019 - 5/2022).<br />
                    I worked on <b class="primary-color">DigiD</b> for <b>Logius</b>,
                    which is one of Capgemini's customers.
                    Here I worked on a variety of items like containerizing, splitting the monolith application into
                    microservices, and connecting to eIDAS (European electronic identification).
                    The thing I am most proud of is unofficially becoming the first point of contact for the Ops teams
                    when they needed help or cooperation from the development teams.
                </li>
                <li><b>Back-end developer | Perfect Web Team</b> (2/2017 - 8/2019).<br />
                    During my studies I worked as a part-time web and back-end developer.
                    The work mostly consisted of making custom Joomla! components using OOP PHP, Git and MySQL.
                    As my graduation-internship I set up a CI/CD environment for PWT.
                </li>
                <li><b>Back-end internship | The Valley</b> (9/2018 - 1/2019).<br />
                    During this internship I worked in a Scrum team, together we redesigned and rebuilt the website <a

                </li>
                <li><b>Back-end internship | Cinnovate</b> (9/2017 - 1/2018).<br />
                    In a team of interns we built a C# Library for <a href="https://www.pozyx.io/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Pozyx</a>.
                    Pozyx is hardware used for indoor location tracking.
                    Cinnovate used this indoor location tracking their projects, mainly a self-driving-wheelchair.

            <p><b lang="nl-NL">HBO-ICT | Windesheim Flevoland</b> (8/2015 - 6/2019).<br />
                During the 1st year of the bachelors we learned a basis of IT skills.
                From the 2nd year onwards we got to apply that knowledge at internships.
                I have done <b class="primary-color">5 internships</b> of each half a year.
                Which gave me a lot of experience working with different technologies, companies and people.
                My minor as part of this bachelors I chose to do abroad, studying for half a year at Wenzhou University
                in China.

            <p>After a day of work I enjoy hanging out on Discord and playing team-based games like Overwatch, Apex
                Legends or
                League of Legends.
                During weekends I enjoy having board game nights or going out for a drink with friends.</p>
            <p>I am constantly looking to <b class="primary-color">learn new things</b>.
                During my free time I often browse Reddit, Youtube or listen to podcasts to learn more about things like
                Kubernetes, Front-end development and pentesting.
