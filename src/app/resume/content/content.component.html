            <hr class="resume-heading-hr" />
            <p>I am a 25 year old software developer. Mainly specialized in back-end web development, besides
                back-end
                work I enjoy working on a wide range of subjects. I take pride in being able to explain complex
                technical
                concepts in layman's terms. Because of this I have often been asked by colleagues to collaborate
                with them
                on a wide variety of items. E.g. Frontend, CI/CD automation, Database Administration, Linux
                Server
                Management and incident response. In this way I see myself as a real <b class="primary-color">team
                    player</b> who is always ready to help others out
            </p>

            <hr class="resume-heading-hr" />
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capgemini</b> (11/2019 - 5/2022). Worked as a back-end developer on <b
                        class="primary-color">DigiD</b> for <b>Logius</b>. Here I worked on a variety of items
                    like
                    containerizing, splitting the monolith application into microservices and connecting to
                    eIDAS (European
                    electronic identification). The thing I am most proud of is unofficially becoming the first
                    point of
                    contact for the Ops teams when they needed help or cooperation from the development teams.
                </li>
                <li><b>Perfect Web Team</b> (2/2017 - 8/2019). During my studies I worked as a part time web and
                    back-end
                    developer. The work mostly consisted of making custom Joomla! components using OOP PHP, Git
                    and MySQL. As
                    my graduation-internship I set up a CI/CD environment for PWT.
                </li>
                <li><b>The Valley</b> (9/2018 - 1/2019). During this internship I worked in a Scrum team,
                    together we redesigned and rebuilt the website <a href="https://www.fcutrecht.nl/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">fcutrecht.nl</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Cinnovate</b> (9/2017 - 1/2018). In a team of interns we build a C# Library for
                    <a href="https://www.pozyx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pozyx</a>. Pozyx
                    is hardware
                    used for indoor location tracking. Cinnovate used this indoor location tracking for some of
                    their
                    projects, mainly a self driving wheelchair.

            <p><b>HBO-ICT at Windesheim Flevoland</b> (8/2015 - 6/2019) is where I
                graduated. During the first year of the study we learned a basis of IT skills. From the 2nd year
                onwards
                we got to apply that knowledge at internships. I have done <b class="primary-color">5
                    internships</b>
                of each half a year. Which gave me a lot of experience working with different technologies,
                companies and
                people. During this study I have also done a Minor, I chose to do this abroad, studying for half
                a year at
                Wenzhou University in China.

            <p>After a day of work I enjoy playing team games like Overwatch, Apex Legends or League of Legends.
                During
                weekends I enjoy having board game nights or going to bars.</p>
            <p>I would love to learn more about Kubernetes, Front-end development and pentesting. During my free
                time I
                often browse Reddit, Youtube or listen to Podcast to learn more about these and other technical
                subjects
